###Prime Factorization

Code to output Prime Factors of numbers in a interactive shell in both Python and C++. In response to one of the challanges posted in https://github.com/karan/Projects.

Code will be improved from time to time. For now numbers larger than a million take a while to generate their factors.

Python implementation is much shorter but C++ implementation is very fast.
